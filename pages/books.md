## Economics:

- <b>Nudge: The Final Edition: Improving Decisions About Money, Health, and the Environment,</b><i>Richard H. Thaler , Cass R. Sunstein</i>

- <b>Unmasking Autism</b>, <i></i>

- <b>Pragmatist Guide To Sexuality,</b><i>Malcolm and Simone Collins</i>

- <b>Focusing</b>, <i>Eugene T. Gendlin</i>
> Very easy and fluid book. Interesting perspective on how much of Psycology tends to be a waste and how much of the ability for healing lies on the patient, not on the therapist.
>However, the practice of the tecnique is much harder then I thought snd more time consuming then reading the book itself, so unless you have some time and focus to invest in this, do not read.
