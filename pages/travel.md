## Why is the risk of sexual violence so high for autistic weman and how big is the problem ?


Evidence suggests that 9 in 10 woman with autism are raped throughout their lives. Scary.
note that this was not a real peer-reviewed study, instead just a survey spread in France. It is not hard to imagine the survey was spread on a particularly vulnerable population or that people who chose to respond are the ones who suffered it, and the ones who didn't suffer didn't have incentives for reporting.
Still, it is not ethical  to ignore such statistics.  
As the prevalence of rape is estimated in 30% of overall population of woman, this would mean a 3 times bigger risk for autistics.

here are some behavioral traits that would explain the difference:

### Naivety:

Every autistic knows what I am talking about. The neighbor or cousin that asked you for money, and you might not want to borrow, but you end up borrowing anyways and is never paid. The phenomena is so common that there is even a term for it: emotional extortion.

The inability to perceive manipulation and lies turns this pupolation particularly vulnerable.

While for a lot of neurotypical (and sometimes even for the law) entering somebody's rooms may imply consent(or even expectation) of a sexual relationship, a lot of autistics are unable to perceive this social cues and contexts and have not realized they were creating this situation for themselves.

Autistics are blunt and honest. if you say “let's go to my room in order to make out” they might simply reply “no thanks” or “yes please”, a lot of NT say instead “dont you wanna check out my new curtain that I bought in my room”, they probably enter without having a cue. 


### longer response-time:

Autistics don't process things at the same speed as NT. autistics don't rely on feelings and intuitions, autistics have to process bit of information for bit of information until they can act. Even worse, if they are in an environment with visual and auditory input, their brains are so busy processing all this junk that it doesn't have a cue about what is happening in their surroundings. All of this makes an autistic to have slower pace and longer response time. While a NT might start screaming or running away from the situation at a greater frequency, an autistic person might freeze for much longer until they can act. (But freeze response is also not uncommon for neurotypical and should be discussed with more care).


### Lack of self-confidence and anger repression:

I am not convinced that this trait is an autistic trait,  instead this is a matter of how autistics are socialized.

Think about it, whenever an autistic child express their anger inappropriately they are punished, with time we just learn that feeling angry is wrong, we disown our own embodied experience.

Society doesn't help with this, as a lot of people still firmly believe some feelings should not be felt and may cause damage to the carrier. The lack of contact with feelings of anger decrease rebellion what leads to an extreme (and dangerous) passivity.

Even for other things too, as people are constantly belittling an autistic point of view, we lack the confidence to state our opinions about what is happening leading to gaslighting. 


### Risky behavior:

Risky behavior is one of the things that appear on several diagnosis on DSM, and it was also one thing my neuro-psychologist evaluated me while assessing me for ADD.



### How big is the problem?


Estimates that 2 % of all woman are autistic, what would mean 1,8% of the entire female population would have this fate. But this number is highly uncertain and could be much bigger, as the assessment for autistics in females are still under diagnosed, more research is needed. It is very hard to determine for sure how many people are autistic given the challenges to find an specialist and the high costs of diagnose. Even if one is not autistic, one can present many symptoms of autism, and this is often the case for relatives.

But this is not the end. A lot of the behavioral traits described above that correlates to a bigger vulnerability also occur on patients of PTSD and complex PTSD.  As it is expected that many victims of sexual abuse will develop PTSD, and as mentioned before, we estimate that 30% of every woman suffer sexual violence , this could mean that the same woman would be more vulnerable to experience the same situation again and again, or even be trapt in a loop of repetirion, also known as reenaction. Therefore, the prevalence of sexual abuse in the autistic population could point to a problem faced by the PTSD community (or even other atypicals) that has escaped the statistics.


Reenaction:

reenaction is the tendency of re-victimization after the first traumatic incident has occurred. Or more generally speaking, is the repetition compulsion, even in other areas of life.


## Problems with the law

There are many countries where if the abuser didn't use force or coercion an unwilling sexual act is not considered rape, unfortunately. Even worse. Old case in Brasil of a woman who entered a guys house, fainted, and where then raped. But the perpetrator was not punished, as the willingness to enter his apartment alone was considered a consent. So if you are autistic you might be putting yourself in a situation that will be used against you, that will be considered a consent and not even know it. 
In most countries a sexual act only turns to rape if the victim fought or said no, in a famous case in Switzerland, 3 man raped a 15 year old with a bottle of wine and were not arrested, as the victims freeze response was taken as a consent from the judge. 
Even with massive research showing that a freeze response is a real phenomena and that it is even more common for patients with PTSD, it is not accepted by the law of many countries. 
Fight and flight response is most communly seemd in man, female actual most common responses are "tend and befriend", even non-authistic ones.


## A manifesto for the sexual rights of autistic

<i>Just because a person doesn't fight back, just because someone does not actively say stop, and just because you don’t “go all the way” doesn’t mean you are not raping another person.

-Malcolm and Simone Collins</i> 

The problem with rape is not the physical pain, it is not the risk of disease or pregnancy, the problem is the objectification. The culture of minimization tries to use the fact that sometimes might feel pleasure on this moment as a reason of why this is not so bad, or the fact that the perpetrator was nice and gentle. All this dialogs misses the point. Rape is not about pleasure or violence, rape is about consent and self determination. 
Somebory diminishing you from your humanity, uses you as an object.

Once you define rape as a break of one's self determination it is clear how it is a matter of boundary violation, and a boundary can be different for every person, and everyone can impose ones own boundaries the way they want, it is your body, you get to set the rules. 

Therefore you having sex with 100 woman in a way and all of them being happy does not mean that the 101st should be willing to want the same. A different person, different boundaries. 

This is why assumed consent is such a toxic behaviour, while a lot or even the majority of weman are okay and are completely capable of stopping you, freeze response is a real thing and way more common than you think. Whenever you decide you do not need to ask for consent you are creating this fate for a portion of the populaion. And  yet, in a lot of countries assumed consent is supported by the law.

A lot of neurotypicals oppose the idea of “enthusiastic consent ”, as they think it “kills the spontaneity”, without realizing the impacts of having sex without explicitly consent causes into the population and the extent of the damage, specially to the ones who are most vulnerable to freeze response. Whenever you decide that you don't need to check for consent you might be raping a person. Whenever you decide you don't need lights on or to close your eyes, you are literally choosing to become blind to what might be the only reliable input about your partners feelings, you are choosing not to know. While “I didn't know you don't want” is the favorite excuse on rape cases, the truth is that you didn't seek to know, that you chose not to know.

And yet many man are just uncapable of accepting any responsibility to avoid those situations, and actually woman too(more on this latter). Everything just part of a culture of minimization and invisibilization that diminishes the pain of a group just for being a minority and being less socially skilled. 


What can be done ? responsibilisation.

We still live in a society that blames the victims for everything, but I hope that by now you may at least grasp why it is not possible to just teach an autistic how to react quickly or defend themselves, that would mean teaching an autistic how to not be autistic, and it is a genetic disorder. The process of training those skills is arduous and inaccessible, and we are talking about a society where less then half of the population have a diagnose. While when it comes to PTSD the treatment takes years, is expensive. So this is not a problem for the neyuroatypical community to solve alone. we need to be recognized. 


#### Autistics and Gaslighting 

Gaslighting is a Form of severe psychological abuse defined by the minimization of somebody else's reality. 
Example:
“you see abuse in everything ”, “it is all in your head ”, "you changed this memory in your head".
Autistics are particularly vulnerable to gaslighting, because we perceive the world differently then the neurotypical and the default is to assume that the autistic perception is wrong.
note that there is nothing that says the neurotypical perception is more accurate than the autistic one.
For example, for a person that has auditory sensibility, which a lot of autistics does, it is very common for others to say "but there is no sound here". Which is a Form of gaslithing, although a non-intended one.
 
Another example. I have often heard that I am rude, even in situations where I did not intended to be, and it is a common complain for autistics. Autistics are blunnt and have trouble modulating their tone, other times because they can't grasp on non-verbal cues and misinterpret the situation.
I also had the experience to be told that I am screaming, even though I don't think I am screaming. And my overcompensation leads me to speak too low a lot of other times. Inability to modulate one's voice is also a common symptom and we are often called out for that.

Once society inflicts you with the fear of being judged, taken by rude and angry, we tend to become more tolerant, and sometimes too tolerant with situations where we should not be.

	the repression of the anger by the parents is the core of autistic repression, it culminates on the autistic toxic passivity and is a the beginning and a fundamental part of the phenomenon known as masking. 


#### Victimhood

No one wants to be a victim. But the rejection and discomfort people feel for this position of victims is exactly what impedes them to change outside of this position. 

If you are black, you should be able to talk about the extra challenges you will face on the work market, even while you fight your place. If you fail to recognize the affects of racism you might be trapped thinking that you have done enough, and that you should have a job already. 

We as autistics are in a position of social vulnerability, if it sounds as disgusting victim hood that let it sound. But once you know you are at a disadvantage you may increase the efforts and find strategies to deal with the problems. The first step, as always.
